# c4_final_project
The Sneaker Closet started out as an elevator pitch idea I had which turned into a fully built website from the ground up as a final project. It's a website made specifically for sneaker enthusiasts to easily meet up in order to buy, sell, and trade collectible sneakers. The site was built utilizing HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, Bootstrap and asynchronous programming on the client side along with PHP/MySQL, Amazon AWS, and Apache on the server side.
