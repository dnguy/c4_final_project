	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>The Sneaker Closet was created for sneaker enthusiasts and aspiring collectors to be able to buy, sell, and trade sneakers. As a fellow sneaker enthusiast, selling shoes
	has always been a hassle. Posting on Ebay or Craigslist can be time consuming so at The Sneaker Closet we try to make the selling process as simple and seamsless as possible.
	Other selling resources also charge ridiculous fees so we try to minimize them as much as possible to maximize your profits. Start selling today or find the shoe
	that you have always wanted in your collection! </p>
